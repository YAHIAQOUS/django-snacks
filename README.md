# Lab: 26 - Intro to Django

## Overview

The first words you see on the Django website are

Django makes it easier to build better Web apps more quickly and with less code.

The next quote you’ll see is

The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines.

In this class we’ll build out a small, but functional, multi page web site using Django.

We’ll get a feel for the “Django Way” and see the dramatic performance gains you can get with a mature, robust framework.
